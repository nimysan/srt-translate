00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,291
This way!

186
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,708
[Mack yells]

187
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,291
What's it gonna be, Drew?

188
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:19,958
[Drew] Hunter or hunted?

189
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:23,083
Fight or flight?

190
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,416
[suspenseful music playing]

191
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,208

[Drew grunting]

[villagers shouting]

00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,083
[Mack sighs]

[eerie music playing]

196
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,500
[eerie night chirping]

197

[spiders chittering]

199
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,041

[eerie music playing]

201
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:32,291
[panting]

202
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,125
[gasps] What?

203
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,291
[man] This is Wyldermen country.

204
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,708
So be on your guard.

205
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:50,750
Right. Ready for your final test?

206
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:51,791
Yes, Master.

207
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:56,291
Go find a place to make camp,
and choose wisely.

208
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:59,625
Fend for yourself,
and I'll return at first light.

209
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,416
-Take the map in case.
-But--

210
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:07,166
I know, I know. One day you won't need it.
But for now, keep it close.

211
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,541
Whatever happens,
you can get back to Brackenholme.

212
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:11,875
[whispers] Brackenholme?

213
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,958
Whitley. You've studied for this test?

214
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,000
[Whitley] Hm.

215
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:20,583
Then, by morning,
you'll be a fully-fledged scout.

216
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,625
And if that doesn't impress my father…

217
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:23,791
[man chuckles]

218
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:30,208

[grunting]

222
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:57,416
Hm. My snare works, then.

223
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:02,375
-You don't look like a Wylderman.
-That's because I'm not.

224
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:03,500
[grunts]

225
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,916
So, you're a thief,
trying to steal my map.

226
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,916
[Drew] Please, just cut me down.

227
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,333
And why would I help
a thief with a stolen sword?

228
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:15,375
My name's Drew. Drew Ferran.
I need to get to Brackenholme.

229
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,750
My mum said to find a man called Bergan?

230
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,125
Duke Bergan is never going to meet
with a lowlife like you.

231
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,750
[mockingly] Whatever your mother says.

232
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:26,708
[Drew gasps]

233
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,750
[scoffs] I haven't got time for this.

234
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:29,666
[Drew cries out]

235
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,666

237
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:37,500
Look…

238
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,791
At least tell me who this Bergan is.

239
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,000
He's only the Duke of Brackenholme.

240
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:46,583
And if you'd ever seen him take the shape
of the Great Bear in battle,

241
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,958
you wouldn't need to ask.

242
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,041
He's a Werelord?

243
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:52,291
The bravest.
The last one to stand up for the people.

244
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,041
Against who?

245
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,833
-The Lions?
-Enough questions!

246
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,666
-But--
-I'm passing this test.

247
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,500
So stay out of my way.

[horse whinnies]

255
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:29,583
[Hogan] No!

256
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,583
-Hello?
-Ugh.

257
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:48,750
[Drew clears throat]

258
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:52,625
Look… What about, if I help you,
you tell me what I need to know.

259
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,000
-Whoa!
-[skull crunches]

260
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,458
-[Drew gasps]
-Oh no.

261
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:56,666
What is it?

262
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,500
It looks like some kind of… [yells]

[Hogan grunts, pants]

269
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:23,625

[suspenseful music playing]

271
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,875
Master Hogan!

272
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:34,541
Run, child!

273
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,083
I'm not leaving you!

Why did they attack?

292
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,666
Whatever this place is,
it's important to them.

293
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,208
We need to get out of here.

294
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:51,000

296
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,708
Poisoned arrow.

297
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,708
-You need to get him to Brackenholme?
-The map's gone.

298
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,166
But he knows the way.

299
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,666
And he's in no state to guide us.

300
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,666
-We need to fix him.
-With what?

301
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,583
We need yellowstem. I know where to look.

302
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,666
Well, don't just sit there. Come on!

I don't understand.

313

She loved him.

314
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:54,666
-He was her favorite.
-He was never like us.

315

-I'm not going like nothing's happened.

They're the law.

325
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm telling them what he did.

-Back up, boy.
-You're looking for Drew Ferran.

I can help you.

330
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,166
I'm his brother.

331
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,041
Was his brother.

332
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,583
Let's hear what he has to say.

333
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:49,666

He's getting worse.

342
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,625
You stay with him.
Let me get the yellowstem.

343
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:24,125
[scoffs] Whatever.
Just don't come back without it.

344
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,916
-And you'll get me to Brackenholme?
-Yeah, if he lives.

345

[both grunting]

00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,583
-Easy, easy.
-[Hogan moans]

378
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:15,541
Will he live?

379
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,916
We've bought him some time.
If his fever breaks.

380
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,833
-Thank you.
-Don't look at me.

381
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,916
-Don't you know what you are?
-Some kind of freak?

382
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,208
You're a Werelord.

383
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,375
-[mystical music plays]
-It takes one to know one.

384
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,541
[gasps] You're a…

385
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:33,750
I'm a Bearlord.

386
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,333
So what does that make me?

387
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:38,250
Well, you must come from
one of Lyssia's seven great houses.

388
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,875
You don't have any idea?

389
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:43,875
My mum, she knew, I think.
She didn't get a chance to tell me.

390
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:47,250
Why do you need to see
Duke Bergan so badly?

391
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:50,458
She made me promise.
It was the last thing she said to me.

392
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,250
I'm sorry.

393
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,916
[Drew sniffles]

394
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,916
Well, whatever you are,
I don't believe you're with the Lions,

395
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
or you'd have left us to the Wyldermen.

396
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:02,333
-Why would the Lions want you dead?
-Because King Leopold is a tyrant.

397
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,708
He's put down every rebel
since he stole the crown.

398
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:05,791
Stole it?

399
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,916
-From the Wolf.
-That's not right.

400
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,291
It is, Drew.

401
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,375
[mysterious music playing]

402
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,791
[Whitley] Each realm had its own Werelord.

403
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,666
[bear growling]

404
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,250
[Whitley] Sharks…

405
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,625
and Stags.

406
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:28,041
Rats and Bears.

407
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,166
Like Duke Bergan.

408
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:36,166
And all the Werelords
pledged allegiance to the noble Wolves

409
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:41,041
until the Lions came and destroyed them.

410
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:45,250
The Wolves held Lyssia together
for centuries.

411
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:46,166
[lion growls]

412
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,000
[Whitley] Now the Lions have
all Seven Realms by the throat.

413
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,041
Everybody lost someone
when the Lions came.

414
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,250
[distant screaming]

415
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,875
[Whitley] Parent, neighbor,

416
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:57,833
sister.

417
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,375
-[dark music playing]
-[lion growling]

418
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:04,666
[Whitley] What the world would give
for the return of a Wolf.

419
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,833
But I thought the Wolf was the tyrant.

420
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:12,583
That's what the Lions want you to believe.

421
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,458
Join us.
We need all the Werelords we can recruit.

422
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:16,375
Why me?

423
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:19,083
-A rebellion has to start somewhere.
-Rebellion?

424
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:21,416
Duke Bergan will tell you what you are.

425
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,458
[sighs] With any luck,
it might spur the old Bear into action.

426
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:25,958
[Hogan cries out] Wyldermen.

427
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:27,333
[groaning]

428
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,541
Shh. Master. You're safe.

429
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:32,125
[Hogan gasping] An Orb Spider.

430
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:33,375
We dealt with it.

431
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:34,291
Idiots.

432
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:37,541
The Wyldermen worship Orb Spiders.

433
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,541
-What does he mean?
-Oh no.

434
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:40,500
The clearing.

435
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:42,958
-Those bones.
-They were laid out like a web.

436
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:45,458
You disturbed their shrine.

437
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:48,333
And now you've killed one of their gods.

438
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,458

[rhythmic beating on trees]

441
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:02,041
We need to move.

[suspenseful music playing]

443
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:06,166
[Hogan] This way!

444
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,458
The Dymling Road!

446

[Whitley] There it is!

447
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:30,541
We made it! Come on. Let's keep moving.

448

-[Chancer whinnies]
-[Whitley] Come on, Chancer!

449
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:36,125
-What's gotten into you?
-Something's wrong.

450
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:43,291
They're hunting us. They're right behind.

451
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:45,458
That's what they wanted us to think.

452
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:48,125
They're herding us. It's a trap!

Drew, where are you?!

[yells]

468
00:24:49,708 --> 00:24:52,875
Go to Brackenholme. Find Duke Bergan.

[bear growling]

479
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:11,125
Wake the healers at the White Oak.
Take Hogan straight to them.

480
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:14,041
[Whitley] Father! [laughs]

481
00:26:15,666 --> 00:26:16,958
This is your father?

482
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:20,375
You are not going to believe
what I have brought home with me.

483
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:22,666
Other than a pack of Wyldermen?

484
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,875
And a boy?

485
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:27,208
Oh, he's more than that. He's a Werelord.

486
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:28,625
A new one.

487
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,500
-Get him up.
-[Drew grunts]

488
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:34,500
My, um…

489
00:26:34,583 --> 00:26:35,791
My mum sent me.

490
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:38,500
She said you'd help me. Help me to--

491
00:26:38,583 --> 00:26:40,416
I don't have time for this.

492
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,000
Ah, ah!

493
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:43,416
We don't want you here!

494
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,416
[Drew grunts]

495
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:47,333
Please! Just hear me out!

496
00:26:47,416 --> 00:26:48,958
Leave! Now!

497
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,541
But… But, Father!

498
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:52,916
No, Whitley.

499
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,166
Wait…

500
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:04,041
But we need him.
To fight back against the Lions.

501
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:07,000
[Duke Bergan] Keep your voice down.
The Lions are already here.

502
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,458

[Drew] What beast am I?

506
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,291
Do I run for my life…

507
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:28,208
or fight for it?

508
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,291
Only the Wolves
could have made a stand against the Lions,

509
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:33,541
and they're gone.

510
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:35,041
You're not listening!

511
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:37,208

512
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:38,833

You're a… You're a Wolf.

521
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:01,875
A Wolf?

522
00:28:02,833 --> 00:28:04,000
The Wolf.

525
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,000
Get back!

-[Whitley gasps] Drew!
-Whitley? [crying out]

528
00:28:25,916 --> 00:28:28,083
Where are you taking him? Father!

529
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:29,916
Stop! Please!

530
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,166
Whitley!

531
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,083
